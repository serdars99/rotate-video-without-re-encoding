# Rotate-video-without-re-encoding
This console app uses ffmpeg orientation option and rotates your videos without re encoding.

# Usage

Drop and drag your video file(s) to this application. It will ask you rotation degree. Options are 0, 90, 180, 270.
In some cases your video may already have some orientation, so choosing 0 degrees can also fix your video orientation by resetting it.


# Note
If you don't know how to build, just take the .exe file in bin/debug folder and use it.
You need to have ffmpeg.exe in the same folder.
